## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
I built this fun and free-to-use trivia game using API integration with a service from www.opentdb.com. Users can select one of several categories and are then presented with a question about that topic and four answer choices. A quick click of their answer and the program informs them if they're correct or not. The user can then continue guessing until they answer correctly.

## Optimizations
Future enhancements for this app include a running "high score" using local storage, and perhaps the ability for the user to select a difficulty level in addition to the category.

## Lessons Learned
My first build did not have clickable response choices. After watching users play the game, it bacame clear that the intuitive action was to click on the answer choice, so I updated the code to support that functionality.
